	    Happs combines positive psychology with technology. Happy + apps = Happs, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZI152QbNwI">get it</a>!?
	  </p>
		<p>
			Remember the <%= link_to "knee analogy", research_path %>? Consider Happs to be your happiness personal trainer. Our app is based off <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-How-Happiness-Approach-Getting/dp/0143114956">The How of Happiness</a> by positive psychology leader <a href="http://psych.ucr.edu/faculty/lyubomirsky/">Dr. Sonja Lybomirsky</a>. There are several resources on positive psychology, however we found this book to be the most pragmatic.

  		Why make Happs?
  	</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
	  <p class="strong">
			There are several reasons and the most important one: we're passionate about making people happier. We are <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Whats_Your_Problem.php">scratching our own itch</a>. We are the both developers and end users.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our competitors, such as
			(<a href="http://www.happify.com/">Happify</a>, <a href="https://www.happier.com/home">Happier</a>, and <a href="http://www.thesmileepidemic.com/smiles/">Smile Epidemic</a>)
			have one or more of the following:
			<ul>
				<li>aren't backed with research</li>
				<li>require you to pay to use</li>
				<li>are cluttered and overcomplicated</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Although our competitors are also our allies when it comes to our mission, we believe that a free, clean, science-backed app is the only way to maximize the benefits that people get when actively working on becoming happier.

			Here are some awesome quotes that have inspired Happs:
			<blockquote>
			  <p>
					In design, where meaning is often controversially subjective or 
					painfully inscrutable, few things are more apparent and lucid than 
					the presence of passion. This is true whether the design of a product 
					delights you or leaves you cold; in either case it’s diﬃcult not to 
					detect the emotional investment of the hands that built it.
			  </p>
			  <small>Khoi Vinh, Subtraction.com and co-founder of Behavior LLC</small>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
			  <p>Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.</p>
			  <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</a></small>

				I used to work at a company that had a negative culture fueled by blame and stress. I knew I wanted that to change and by chance, I heard about positive psychology through a <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED Talk</a>. I was instantly hooked and bought several books on the subject. After starting several initiatives to change the culture, I learned that culture must be changed from the top down and the company had other priorities. That's when I started messing around with web development and now have my time taken up by my three passions (in ascending order!): web development, positive psychology, and my beautiful wife, Kristin.
