<h2>Why make happs?</h2>
<hr>
<p>
	There are several reasons happs had to be made and the most important one: <strong>we're passionate about making people happier</strong>. We are <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Whats_Your_Problem.php">scratching our own itch</a>. We are the both developers and end users.
</p>
<p>
	Our competitors, such as
	(<a href="http://www.happify.com/">Happify</a>, <a href="https://www.happier.com/home">Happier</a>, and <a href="http://www.thesmileepidemic.com/smiles/">Smile Epidemic</a>)
	have one or more of the following:
	<ul>
		<li>aren't backed with research</li>
		<li>require you to pay to use</li>
		<li>are cluttered and overcomplicated</li>
	</ul>
	Although our competitors are also our allies when it comes to our mission, we believe that a free, clean, science-backed app is the only way to maximize the benefits that people get when actively working on becoming happier.

		In design, where meaning is often controversially subjective or

		the presence of passion. This is true whether the design of a product 
		delights you or leaves you cold; in either case it’s diﬃcult not to 
		detect the emotional investment of the hands that built it.
